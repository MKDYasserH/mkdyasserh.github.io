<h2>Overview</h2>
In this project, we are developing a multi-modal emotion recognition system that goes beyond traditional methods by incorporating multiple sources of input, such as facial expressions, voice tonality, and text analysis. The goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate model for understanding and interpreting human emotions in various contexts.

<h2>Features</h2>

- **Facial Expression Analysis:**
  - Detect and analyze facial expressions using computer vision techniques.
  - Recognize key facial landmarks and expressions associated with different emotions.

- **Audio Features Analysis:**
  - Utilize audio processing to capture and analyze the tonal variations in speech.
  - Identify patterns in pitch, intensity, and tempo to infer emotional states.

- **Textual Data Analysis:**
  - Process extracted text to infer emotional cues.

- **Multi-Modal Fusion:**
  - Integrate information from facial expressions, audio features, and text to create a holistic understanding of the user's emotional state.
  - Develop fusion strategies to combine modalities effectively for improved accuracy.

- **Real-Time Emotion Recognition:**
  - Implement algorithms that allow for real-time analysis of emotions as they unfold.
  - Enable the system to provide instantaneous feedback based on the recognized emotions.

- **Emotion Trend Analysis:**
  - Provide insights into the temporal patterns of emotions, allowing for trend analysis over time.
  - Identify recurring emotional states and potential triggers.
