<h2>Overview</h2>
The AI news aggregator works like an online newspaper. An artificial intelligence-based algorithm can automatically check the URLs of articles from multiple online newspapers. The similar articles are categorized. For example, if there are five articles (URLs) regarding Cyclone Freddy, those five URLs are grouped together and their content is extracted. Another algorithm based on PRIMERA then generates a single article based on the input 5 sources.

<h2>Features</h2>

  - Users can submit news websites URLs for analysis by the system.

- **Monitoring Article Similarity:**

  - Uncertain articles can be discarded by users to refine the accuracy of the analysis.

- **Multi-Source Text Summarization:**
  - The system supports multi-source text summarization.
  - The system generates a concise summary by extracting key information from each source of the similar news articles.

- **Proofreading Article Summaries:**
